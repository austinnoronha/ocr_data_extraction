# OCR Data Extraction Evaluation

This project aims to evaluate the efficiency of various Python libraries for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) in extracting data from images. We are currently exploring and comparing the performance of libraries such as EasyOCR, Tesseract, OpenCV, MediaPipe (Google), and more.

## Demo Overview

In the "media" folder, you'll find a set of images containing text, embedded objects, or a combination of both. Our objective is to assess how well each OCR library handles different scenarios and to identify the most suitable solution for our specific use case.

## Libraries Being Evaluated

- **EasyOCR**: https://pypi.org/project/easyocr/
- **Tesseract**: https://pypi.org/project/tesseract/
- **OpenCV**: https://pypi.org/project/python-opencv-utils/
- **MediaPipe (Google)**: https://pypi.org/project/mediapipe/

## Usage

To test the OCR data extraction, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/OCR-Data-Extraction.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd OCR-Data-Extraction
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run the demo script:

    ```bash
    python demo.py
    ```
